[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,gulp,webpack,html,sass,vscode)](https://skillicons.dev)

### Short description
Front-end layer for on-line store. Desktop, tablet and mobile design. BEM.
I've found this online-store template on my HTML-Academy subsription letters.
The level of this template is intermediate.
It was very interesting to deal with changing order&size elements and before/after slider.
Here I've set up gulpfile.js with webpack-stream and added import for BEM modules.
